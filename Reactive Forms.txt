Reactive forms in Angular utilize the FormBuilder service to create and manage form controls, groups, and arrays in a more structured and efficient way. FormBuilder simplifies the process of creating form models by providing factory methods for FormControl, FormGroup, and FormArray. This approach results in cleaner, more maintainable code, especially for complex forms. 
Here's a breakdown of how FormBuilder is used in reactive forms:
1. Importing Modules and Service:
Import ReactiveFormsModule in your AppModule or the module where the form will be used.
Import FormBuilder from @angular/forms.
Inject FormBuilder into the component's constructor. 
2. Creating the Form Model:
Use the FormBuilder's group() method to create a FormGroup.
Within the group() method, define the form controls using the control() method, or directly within the object using an array for initial values and validators.
Example: 
TypeScript

    import { FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
    
    export class MyFormComponent {
      myForm = this.fb.group({
        firstName: ['', Validators.required],
        lastName: ['', Validators.required],
        email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]
      });
    
      constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { }
    }
3. Binding Form Controls in the Template:
Use the formGroup directive to bind the FormGroup to the form element.
Use the formControlName directive to bind individual form controls to input elements.
Example: 
Code

    <form [formGroup]="myForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
      <input type="text" formControlName="firstName">
      <input type="text" formControlName="lastName">
      <input type="email" formControlName="email">
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
4. Validation and Submission:
Add validators to the form controls using the Validators class or custom validator functions. 
Access form values and validity using the value and status properties of the FormGroup and FormControl. 
Handle form submission by accessing the value of the FormGroup. 
Key Advantages of using FormBuilder:
Reduced Boilerplate: Simplifies the creation of form models, especially nested forms. 
Readability: Makes the form structure more explicit and easier to understand. 
Testability: Makes reactive forms easier to test due to the explicit nature of the form model. 
Maintainability: Improves code maintainability by providing a clear and structured way to manage form controls.
