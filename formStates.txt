Introduction:
============

Angular form Validation - Validation is the process of verifying user input. 

- Validation is required to insured that contradictory and unauthorized data is not get stored 
into the database. 

- Client side validations can be handled by using patterns, regular expressions and 
functions. 

- Angular provides predefined services to handle validation. - The angular validation services are categories into two types. 

1)Form state validation services. 
2)Input state validation services. 


Form state services:- - 

The form state validation services can verify all input field in a form simultaneously - At the same time and return a Boolean value - The varies form state services are : 

Service        Property 	Description 
----------     --------		-----------
ngPristine     pristine         It verifies whether any field in the form have 
				modified its value with user input its return true 
				when no field modified.   


ngDirty       dirty              It return Boolean true if any one field has been modify



ngInvalid    invalid            It return true when at least one field is invalid. 


ngValid       valid             It return true only when all field are valid. 

ngSubmitted   submitted         It return true only when the form is submitted. 


2. Input state validation services : 
Angular provides predefined services that are used to verify the state of every field individually.

errors 		errors 		It is an input field object that contains collection of 
				error properties. That are used to verify specific error in the field.


Angular Built-in validation CSS classes. 
- Angular provides a set of “predefined” CSS classes for validation.

- The built-in classes can identify the state and apply effects automatically to any specified 
element. 

- The built in classes doesn’t have any predefined effects you have to configure the effects 
manually [explicitly] 
- The angular CSS classes are : 

Class name 	Description  
----------	-----------
.ng-valid       Applies effect when the input state is valid. 
.ng-invalid     Applies effect when input state is invalid 
.ng-pristine     Applies effect when the input field not yet modified. 
.ng-dirty        Applies effect when input field is modify. 
.ng-touched      Applies effect when input field touched. 
.ng-untouched    Applies effect when input field untouched.
